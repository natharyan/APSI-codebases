# PICS
This is a Rust implementation for the Private Intersection over Committed Sets (PICS) protocol in the paper *PICS: Private Intersection over Committed (and reusable) Sets*

# How to use
The project contains many bin files that is used to test each small part.
For running the PSI protocol as a proof-of-work, please use the following command:
> cargo run --release --bin oprf (role) (ip) (port) (log_set_size) (num_threads) (lpn_param) (sender_commit) (receiver_commit)

Currently, we support three sets of LPN parameters: LPN17, LPN21, LPN25 (correspondingly, lpn_param=0,1,2), which are suitable for running $2^{17}$, $2^{21}$, and $2^{25}$ VOLEs.
